```
What does this look like?!
```

[findme.txt](https://github.com/Lev9L-Team/ctf/tree/master/2018-08-16_hackcon/find_me_asap/findme.txt)

So there is a text. After the first look, we guess there are ASCII characters. 
So we wrote a program, which read the file and convert the integer values to characters.
Our guess was right and we get some text. 

The text in [result.txt](https://github.com/Lev9L-Team/ctf/tree/master/2018-08-16_hackcon/find_me_asap/result.txt)
are the result of the integer values of the [findme.txt](https://github.com/Lev9L-Team/ctf/tree/master/2018-08-16_hackcon/find_me_asap/findme.txt)
file.

We read the text and get the flag: 
```
d4rk{4sc11_n_gr3p}c0de
```
